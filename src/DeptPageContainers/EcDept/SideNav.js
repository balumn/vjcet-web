The Department is managed by devoted and diligent staff members and well equipped with all modern facilities. The first batch of ECE students from Viswajyothi passed out in 2005. Dept. offers both undergraduate (B. Tech.) and postgraduate (M. Tech.) programs. The annual intake of the B. Tech. program is 120 students and that of the M. Tech. is 24. Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) is a swiftly advancing field, with new ideas emerging every other second. There are a lot of exciting avenues to explore and create even better ideas. With technology becoming all pervasive in everyday life, opportunities for electronic engineers are endless.
